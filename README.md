Care Count — BLIP-assisted inventory logging with Supabase (Streamlit).

# Care Count App

## What this app is supposed to do
Care Count is meant to be a simple but powerful tool for food banks.  
The vision:  
- Volunteers take a picture of donated items.  
- The app figures out the item name (using vision or text recognition).  
- It logs that item into a Supabase database.  
- From there, we can track inventory, volunteer hours, and monthly reports.  

Basically, it’s supposed to be a **BLIP-assisted inventory logger with Streamlit + Supabase**.  

---

## What it does so far
- I have a **Streamlit frontend** running.  
- The UI has a basic volunteer interface with a placeholder for scanning barcodes / uploading images.  
- The Supabase connection boilerplate is in place (so I can save data once it’s ready).  
- README + setup files are working with Python 3.11 and Streamlit SDK pinned.  

So right now it’s more like a **starter shell**: UI + database hooks, but not yet the full intelligence part.

## Where I am stuck
- The big block is getting **the model connection working**.  
- I keep hitting errors like: *“model not found”* or *“fallback mode missing.”*  
- Hugging Face Spaces didn’t let me just enable internet access (that option isn’t visible).  
- My goal is: take an image → get food item name (either OCR text or vision model guess).  

So I’m stuck at the **core loop**:  
Image → Item name → Save to Supabase.  

---

## Paths I’ve already tried
- **BLIP model** → integrated but fails with model not found.  
- **Tried Hugging Face image-to-text** → works for captions but not consistent for item names.  
- **OCR approach** → only useful if the packaging has readable text (not for loose produce).  
- **Looked for “Hardware & resources → internet access” in Hugging Face Spaces** → doesn’t exist.  
- **Tried patching `streamlit_app.py` with fallback modes** → still errors.  

Right now the blocker is **reliable model access** inside the app.

## Feynman summary (in plain words)
This project is about making food bank inventory logging automatic.  
- A person uploads a photo.  
- The computer should answer one simple question: **“What food item is this?”**  
- If the app knows the name, it saves it into a database for tracking.  

The tricky part:  
- Sometimes the name is written (like “Kellogg’s Cornflakes”), so OCR works.  
- Sometimes there’s no text (like apples), so we need a vision model.  
- The app needs to switch between both methods.  

Right now the UI and database parts are ready, but the brain (image → item name) is where I’m still stuck.  

---

## Next steps
- Fix model access so the app can call Hugging Face models properly.  
- Build fallback logic: OCR first, then vision model if no text is found.  
- Push working code so volunteers can test with real food items.
